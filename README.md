# DS220: Data Modeling - Exercise 11

I wanted to try [KDM][1] capabilities to model a Cassandra database. Since I'm watching self-paced Datastax modeling course (DS220), I used the example of exercise 11 to practice a bit with KDM.

You'll find the initial E/R model provided by exercise text, and my solution created with KDM. My solution differs respect to the one proposed by [@mrCompScience][2] alias Jamie King, since I did not put _character name_ as cluster column. I think that video list of Q2 and Q3 should avoid duplicates.

However, I've reached the goal to practice a bit with KDM. At the moment it's still green, but it have the potential of becoming a really nice tool.
